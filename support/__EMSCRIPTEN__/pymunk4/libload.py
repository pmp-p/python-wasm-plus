Failed to load pymunk library.

This error usually means that you don't have a compiled version of chipmunk in 
the correct spot where pymunk can find it. pymunk does not include precompiled 
chipmunk library files for all platforms. 

The good news is that it is usually enough (at least on *nix and OS X) to 
simply run the compile command first before installing and then retry again:

You compile chipmunk with
> python setup.py build_chipmunk
and then continue as usual with 
> python setup.py install
> cd examples
> python basic_test.py

(for complete instructions please see the readme file)

If it still doesnt work, please report as a bug on the issue tracker at 
http://code.google.com/p/pymunk/issues
Remember to include information about your OS, which version of python you use 
and the version of pymunk you tried to run. A description of what you did to 
trigger the error is also good. Please include the exception traceback if any 
(usually found below this message).
